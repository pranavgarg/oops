Three pillars of Object Oriented Programming : Python

##ENCAPSULATION
Methods to **gate** the way the data gets stored inside the class.
 
- getter 
- setter  
- constructor

##INHERITANCE
- One class can inherit from another, in particular its methods are inherited in the child class. 
- Simply one other level of attribute lookup: _instance_ then _class_, then _inherited classes_.

Benefits
- helps in removing duplicate code by allowing use of parent/base class to have common functions

##POLYMORPHISM



Examples of each of the OOP are given in this repository for quick remembrance.
